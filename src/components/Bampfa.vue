      I worked for 4.5 years as the Web Editor and Electronic Communications
      Manager at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. My
      responsibilities spanned a wide range of tasks including web design and
      development, UI/UX testing and design, communications strategy,
      information architecture, database design, hiring and managing contractors
      and work-study students, and more. I have in-depth firsthand knowledge of
      many of the challenges facing arts and education institutions today, and
      learned how to leverage technological solutions to help alleviate those
      challenges.
