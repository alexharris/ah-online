        Other Brother Beer is a new brewery in Seaside, Ca. When they contacted me, the brick and mortar brewery was opening up soon, and they needed their site up and running on a short timeline. This was achieved through solid project management and a focus on core functionality. I also provided documentation on how to complete basic content update tasks, and now the staff can run the site themselves.
