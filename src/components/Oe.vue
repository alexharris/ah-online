          Open Engagement is an annual conference for socially engaged art. I maintained their website over the course of a few years, and in that time got to experience how small organizations can do big things (hint: it takes a lot of work). Technology can be a powerful tool for enabling this work. On hiatus from doing their annual conference, the site I set up for OE now serves, amongst other things, as an archive and respository to chronicle all of the cool stuff they made happen.
